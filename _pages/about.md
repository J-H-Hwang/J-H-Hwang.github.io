I am a Ph.D student at MCML [(Multimedia Computing and Machine Learning) Group](http://mcml.yonsei.ac.kr) under the supervision of Prof. Jong-Seok Lee. I received B.S. degree from Yonsei University in 2019.

I am interested in exploring the properties of various deep learning models to understand neural networks better.
In particular, I have focused on analyzing the vulnerability of NNs and what elements including architectural components and input data contribute to the diverse behavior of models.
Based on these interests, I aim to contribute to robust and reliable AI systems for diverse tasks and real-world scenarios.
